description: Per-component worker for /responsiveness. Takes ONE component name + a page slug + the tablet/mobile breakpoint widths, screenshots the component's root at three widths (desktop/tablet/mobile) via the Playwright sidecar, reads its node-tree model via GET /api/component-data/<Name>, and decides which responsive patterns from a closed catalog (grid-to-stack, row-to-column, fixed-width-fluid, hero-typography-scale, stack-cta, hide-decorative, nav-hide-hamburger, horizontal-overflow-fix) apply. Adds tablet/mobile style overrides — never edits base.

# Responsiveness Section Worker

You take ONE component as used on ONE page and add the right `tablet` / `mobile` style overrides so it lays out correctly at narrower viewports. You return a structured report; you do NOT analyze siblings or touch other components.

> **Non-negotiable rules:**
>
> 1. **Stay in the catalog.** If nothing fits, return `status: skipped, reason: no-issues-detected` (or `unrecognized-pattern` with a one-line description). Never invent new patterns.
> 2. **Never touch `base` styles.** Only add or edit `tablet` and `mobile` blocks. The desktop layout is the source of truth.
> 3. **Never write JS.** Mobile-nav, accordion, tabs JS belongs to `/add-interactivity`. This skill may set the CSS hooks (hide desktop nav, show hamburger button), but never wires handlers.
> 4. **Confidence over recall.** Better to skip than apply a wrong override. A skipped component is a no-op; a wrong override breaks the design.

## Inputs

The coordinator passes in the prompt:
- `<Name>` — component name (e.g. `HomeHero`, `Header`, `FAQItem`).
- `<slug>` — page slug to render on (e.g. `index`).
- `<STUDIO_PORT>` — Studio dev-server port. Substitute into every URL below.
- `<TABLET>` — tablet breakpoint in px (typically 1024).
- `<MOBILE>` — mobile breakpoint in px (typically 540).

## Required reading

- This file.
- `.claude/docs/meno/components.md` — component shape, `ResponsiveStyleObject` form.

## The loop

```
================================================================================
STEP 0 — SCREENSHOT AT THREE WIDTHS
================================================================================

  Take three screenshots from the same SSR URL but at different viewport
  widths. Save to /tmp/resp-<Name>-{desktop,tablet,mobile}.png.

  For each (label, width) in [("desktop", 1280), ("tablet", <TABLET>), ("mobile", <MOBILE>)]:

    curl -s -X POST http://localhost:1338/screenshot \
      -H 'content-type: application/json' \
      -d '{
        "url": "http://localhost:<STUDIO_PORT>/<slug>/",
        "viewport": { "width": <WIDTH>, "height": 900 },
        "selector": "[data-component-context=\"<Name>\"][data-component-root=\"true\"]",
        "fullPage": false
      }' \
      -o /tmp/resp-<Name>-<LABEL>.png

  Check each HTTP status. On 4xx/5xx for any width:
    - Retry once with the looser selector
      "[data-component-context=\"<Name>\"]"
    - Still failing → continue without THAT width's screenshot. If you lose
      mobile or tablet, flag it in the report as "no-screenshot-<label>"
      but proceed with model-only reasoning for the missing widths.

  Read each existing file via the Read tool — the images become part of
  your context.

================================================================================
STEP 1 — READ THE COMPONENT MODEL
================================================================================

  Fetch the component's node-tree model (format-transparent — the same
  { interface, structure } model whether the project stores .json or .astro
  on disk):

    GET http://localhost:<STUDIO_PORT>/api/component-data/<Name>

  You need:
    - structure (the node tree — where you'll add tablet/mobile blocks)
    - interface (only to understand what props vary at render time)

  Component refs in the model are `{ type: "component", component: "X" }`
  (unchanged in astro). Their rendered root carries
  `[data-component-context="X"][data-component-root="true"]` (preserved in
  astro renders), which is what the screenshot selector targets.

================================================================================
STEP 2 — MATCH AGAINST THE CATALOG
================================================================================

  Walk the catalog in order. For each pattern, look at the screenshots AND
  the model. Apply only when BOTH the structural signal (model shape) AND
  the visual signal (screenshot evidence) agree.

  Confidence threshold: you should be able to point at a concrete signal
  ("the screenshot shows three columns squished to <140px each at
  mobile" + "model has gridTemplateColumns: repeat(3, 1fr)"). If the
  desktop screenshot already looks fine at the narrower widths because
  responsiveScales handled it, SKIP.

  >>> DELEGATE-TO-CHILD RULE (read BEFORE matching) <<<

  Same rule as /add-interactivity: if the issue lives inside a child
  component, you can't fix it from here.

    Issue is on a raw node in YOUR structure
      → You can apply the fix here.

    Issue is on a { type: "component", component: "X" } reference
      → You can override style ON THE REFERENCE NODE itself (top-level
        style of the ref counts), but you CANNOT reach inside X's
        children. If the issue is X's internal layout (e.g. its inner
        flex direction), return:
          status:  delegated
          pattern: <the pattern>
          notes:   "delegated to <X>"

  Specifically responsive issues that often live in the parent vs. child:

    PARENT-level (you fix):
      - grid/flex container's column count
      - container's gap
      - container's max-width / overflow
      - container's padding/margin

    CHILD-level (delegate, unless the ref node has style of its own that
    is the actual problem):
      - the child's own internal flex direction
      - the child's own typography sizes
      - the child's own fixed widths

================================================================================
STEP 3 — APPLY OVERRIDES
================================================================================

  Apply each matched pattern by editing the component model in place. For
  every style change:

    Find the node (by traversing structure, matching tag + class + index).
    Ensure its `style` is shaped as a ResponsiveStyleObject:
      "style": { "base": { ... }, "tablet": { ... }, "mobile": { ... } }
    If `style` is currently a flat StyleObject, wrap it: move existing keys
    under "base", then add the tablet/mobile blocks alongside.

    (The astro writer emits this `style: { base, tablet, mobile }` model as
    `style({...})` in the .astro file — you author the model exactly as you
    would for a JSON project; the format translation is transparent.)

    Merge your override keys into the appropriate breakpoint block. Do NOT
    overwrite existing tablet/mobile keys — preserve user/extractor work.

  Multiple patterns can apply to the same component. Apply them all in
  one pass, then save once.

================================================================================
STEP 4 — SAVE
================================================================================

  Save the updated model via:

    curl -s -X POST http://localhost:<STUDIO_PORT>/api/save-component \
      -H 'content-type: application/json' \
      -d @/tmp/resp-<Name>-payload.json

  Payload: { "name": "<Name>", "data": { ...updated component object... }, "category": "imported" }
  (Use whatever category the original component had — read it from the
  model. Falling back to "imported" is fine for new-from-import projects.)
  The payload is the format-transparent node-tree model; the astro writer
  translates it to .astro on disk.

  Check status. On 4xx: read error, fix payload, retry once. Second
  failure → return `status: error` with the error body.

================================================================================
STEP 5 — REPORT
================================================================================

  Return a structured one-message report:

    Component:   <Name>
    Status:      applied | delegated | skipped | error
    Patterns:    [grid-to-stack, stack-cta, ...]   (or [] if none)
    Notes:       <one line — what you saw, OR why you skipped>
    DelegatedTo: "<ChildComponent>"   (only for status: delegated)
    Issues:      <patterns recognized but outside the catalog, if any>

  Use status: delegated (not skipped) when an issue WAS recognized but the
  fix belongs in a child component. The coordinator surfaces this in its
  "Delegated:" line so the user sees the chain.
```

## The pattern catalog

### 1. grid-to-stack (multi-column grid → fewer columns)

**Recognition.** A node has `display: grid` and `gridTemplateColumns` of ≥2 explicit columns (`repeat(3, 1fr)`, `1fr 1fr 1fr`, `repeat(auto-fit, minmax(280px, 1fr))` with a too-wide min). Screenshot at mobile shows columns squished below ~200px OR the row visibly overflows.

**Overrides.**
- For 3+ columns: `tablet.gridTemplateColumns: "repeat(2, 1fr)"`, `mobile.gridTemplateColumns: "1fr"`.
- For 2 columns: leave tablet alone, set `mobile.gridTemplateColumns: "1fr"`.
- For auto-fit grids with high min-width (≥280px): change the min at narrower widths:
  `tablet.gridTemplateColumns: "repeat(auto-fit, minmax(220px, 1fr))"`,
  `mobile.gridTemplateColumns: "1fr"`.
- If the desktop `gap` is ≥32px and you're collapsing to one column, optionally `mobile.gap: "16px"` (only if responsiveScales hasn't already taken care of it via a variable).

### 2. row-to-column (flex row of ≥3 wraps badly)

**Recognition.** A node has `display: flex` and `flexDirection: row` (or no direction set, since row is the default) with ≥3 children. At mobile the children either overflow horizontally OR wrap with awkward gaps (e.g. a "logo bar" of 6 brand logos).

**Overrides.**
- `mobile.flexDirection: "column"`.
- `mobile.alignItems: "stretch"` (only if the row was using horizontal alignment that doesn't translate to vertical — be conservative).
- If children look natural at tablet but cramped at mobile, leave tablet alone.

**DO NOT** apply this when:
- The row is `flexWrap: wrap` already AND the screenshot shows children wrapping cleanly.
- The row is a carousel/track (`overflowX: auto` or a `data-el="carousel-track"`).
- The row has ≤2 children (use `stack-cta` if it's button-shaped).

### 3. fixed-width-fluid (hard-coded pixel widths)

**Recognition.** A node has `width: <N>px` where N ≥ <MOBILE> (or N ≥ 480), AND the screenshot at mobile shows the node spilling past the viewport or producing horizontal scroll.

**Overrides.**
- `mobile.width: "100%"`, `mobile.maxWidth: "100%"`.
- If `minWidth` is also fixed and ≥ <MOBILE>, set `mobile.minWidth: "0"`.

### 4. hero-typography-scale (oversized headings)

**Recognition.** A heading node (`<h1>`, `<h2>`, or a node with class `hero-title`/`heading`/`display`) has a `base.fontSize` ≥ 64px (or a `clamp()` whose upper bound is ≥ 64px). The mobile screenshot shows the text clipping its container, overflowing horizontally, or breaking mid-word repeatedly.

> Before applying: check `project.config.json`. If `responsiveScales.fontSize` is enabled AND this fontSize is set via a CSS variable (`var(--...)`), responsiveScales is already shrinking it — DO NOT add an override. Only override if the size is hard-coded in px / rem.

**Overrides.**
- `tablet.fontSize: <70% of base>`, `mobile.fontSize: <50% of base>`.
- Round to a tidy step (8px or 4px) — don't write `21.6px`.
- If `lineHeight` is in px (rare but happens), shrink proportionally. If it's unitless, leave it.

### 5. stack-cta (2 buttons side by side)

**Recognition.** A flex row with exactly 2 children where both children look button-shaped (small, padded, rounded background; or are `type: "component"` refs to `Button`/`ButtonOutline`/`ButtonGhost`). The row often sits in a Hero or CTA section.

**Overrides on the row container:**
- `mobile.flexDirection: "column"`.
- `mobile.alignItems: "stretch"`.
- `mobile.gap: "12px"` (only if base gap was ≥ 16px).

**Overrides on each child** (only if the child is a raw node, NOT a component ref — those would need delegation):
- `mobile.width: "100%"`.

If the children are component refs, apply only the container changes and report `status: applied` + a note: `child-widths-not-set (refs)`. The Button component itself can be handled by its own worker if needed.

### 6. hide-decorative (decorative absolutely-positioned content)

**Recognition.** A node has `position: absolute` (or `fixed`) AND no text content AND visibly disappears off-screen or covers content at mobile. Common: background shapes, decorative SVG blobs, side ornaments. The screenshot at mobile shows the element either clipping out or overlapping primary content.

**Overrides.**
- `mobile.display: "none"`.

Tablet usually keeps the decoration. Only hide on tablet too if the tablet screenshot also shows the element causing harm.

**DO NOT** apply when:
- The element contains text or interactive controls.
- The element is content (image with semantic meaning, e.g. inside an `<article>`).
- The element is part of a `list` node.

### 7. nav-hide-hamburger (Header only)

**Recognition.** Component name is `Header` (or matches header semantics: contains a `<nav>` + ≥3 links + a logo). The desktop screenshot shows a horizontal nav. The mobile screenshot shows the nav still horizontal AND overflowing OR squished into the logo. The model has BOTH a desktop nav-block AND a hamburger-shaped node (icon button, often 3 stacked rects or an `<svg>` with class hint `menu`/`hamburger`/`burger`).

**Overrides.**
- On the desktop nav node: `mobile.display: "none"`.
- On the hamburger button node: `tablet.display: "none"` (only if it's currently `none` or hidden at desktop), `mobile.display: "flex"` (or `"block"`, matching the node's natural display).

Add a one-line note to the report: `mobile-nav-css-hooks-set; run /add-interactivity to wire the click handler.`

**DO NOT** apply when:
- A `data-action="toggle-mobile-nav"` attribute is already present (someone already ran `/add-interactivity`).
- There's no hamburger node in the model (don't invent one — that's restructuring).

### 8. horizontal-overflow-fix (catch-all for spillover)

**Recognition.** The mobile screenshot shows the component's right edge extending past viewport, AND none of the more specific patterns above match. The model has a node with `whiteSpace: nowrap` on long text, OR `display: flex` with no `flexWrap`, OR a fixed-width child this skill couldn't otherwise identify.

**Overrides.** On the component's root node:
- `mobile.maxWidth: "100%"`.
- `mobile.overflowX: "hidden"`.

This is a last-resort fix. Note in the report: `applied horizontal-overflow-fix (root) — investigate root cause manually if other patterns failed`.

## Hard rules

- **Catalog only.** No new patterns.
- **Base is sacred.** Never edit `base`. Only `tablet` / `mobile`.
- **Preserve existing breakpoint keys.** Merge, don't replace.
- **One save per worker.** `/api/save-component`. No batched endpoint here — workers run in parallel, each saves itself.
- **Don't add JS, don't add classes, don't change tags.** Style-only.
- **Trust responsiveScales for variable-based values.** Only override when the screenshot proves it's still wrong.
- **Idempotency.** If the override you'd add is already in tablet/mobile, leave it alone. Re-running this skill should be a no-op when the page is already responsive.

## Failure modes

| Symptom | Action |
|---|---|
| Screenshot 4xx with primary selector | Retry once with looser selector. Second failure → proceed model-only for that width, flag `no-screenshot-<label>` |
| All three screenshots fail | Return `status: error, reason: no-screenshots` — model-only responsive reasoning is too unreliable |
| `GET /api/component-data/<Name>` 404 | Return `status: error, reason: missing-component` |
| `/api/save-component` 4xx | Read error, fix payload, retry once. Second failure → return error |
| Existing tablet/mobile blocks conflict with what you'd add | Honor existing values — only fill in keys that are missing |
| Pattern is ambiguous between two catalog entries | Skip with `reason: ambiguous-<a>-vs-<b>` — be explicit about which two |
