name: site-importer-interactions
description: Autonomous worker that transforms the raw interactions.json (hover/focus/click-to-open diffs from the Playwright probe) into a patch-plan.json — a selector-keyed list of style diffs the coordinator joins against components after componentization finishes. Runs in PARALLEL with the coordinator and site-importer-variables during STEP 2. Does NOT modify components directly (the coordinator is the only writer for components in STEP 2).

# Interactions Sub-Agent

You convert the raw probe output into a structured patch plan that's ready to apply to components once they exist. You **never write components** — that would race with the coordinator. Your output is a single file: `rendered-websites/<host>/pages/<pageSlug>/patch-plan.json`.

The coordinator dispatches you after step 2e (html-to-meno-fragment), in parallel with `site-importer-variables` and the coordinator's own componentization. After all three return, the coordinator joins your patch plan against the components it has just written and applies the diffs via a final batched `/api/save-components`.

> **Format note (astro project).** Your input (`interactions.json`) and output (`patch-plan.json`) both live under `rendered-websites/` (scratch), which is UNCHANGED in the astro format. You never touch project files. So your whole job is format-agnostic; nothing below changes for `.astro` projects.

## Inputs

The coordinator dispatches you with:
- `host` — canonical hostname
- `pageSlug` — usually `"home"`

Your input files (already on disk):
- `rendered-websites/<host>/pages/<pageSlug>/interactions.json` — raw probe output from sidecar `/probe-interactions`

Schema of `interactions.json`:
```json
{
  "hover": [
    { "selector": ".cta-button.primary", "diff": { "color": ["rgb(...)", "rgb(...)"], "background-color": [...] } },
    ...
  ],
  "focus": [
    { "selector": "input.email", "diff": { "border-color": [...], "outline-color": [...] } },
    ...
  ],
  "clickToOpen": [
    { "triggerSelector": "button.menu-toggle", "triggerText": "...", "revealedHtml": "<div>...</div>", "revealedSelector": ".menu-panel", "domDelta": 2048 },
    ...
  ]
}
```

## Required reading

- `.claude/docs/meno/components.md` — specifically the `interactiveStyles` section. The diffs you emit map directly onto this schema.

You do NOT need any page-conversion or CMS doc.

## Context discipline

Your input file is small (usually 1–10 KB), so the standard "don't `cat` large files" rule is less hot for you. Still:

- Read `interactions.json` once via `jq` or direct read; don't repeatedly cat it.
- Your output (`patch-plan.json`) should be ≤50KB even for busy pages.

## The flow

```
STEP 1 — READ + GROUP

  1a. jq '.hover'    interactions.json  → array of hover diffs
  1b. jq '.focus'    interactions.json  → array of focus diffs
  1c. jq '.clickToOpen' interactions.json → array of menu/modal triggers

  If interactions.json is missing → write an empty patch-plan.json and exit.
  An empty plan is a valid outcome.

STEP 2 — NORMALIZE HOVER DIFFS

  For each hover entry:
    2a. Skip if the diff has zero meaningful properties (rare, but the probe
        sometimes returns same-color → same-color due to rgb-rounding noise).
    2b. NORMALIZE colors: rgb() / rgba() → hex. Matches what the extractor
        emits inline, so the join step doesn't have to do color-format math.
    2c. Filter out properties that aren't worth a hover transition:
        - text-decoration-color if also text-decoration-line changed
          (the line presence change wins)
        - any property where [from, to] are equal after normalization
    2d. Tag the entry with the most-likely COMPONENT FAMILY:
        - selector contains "btn" or "button" or has "background-color" diff
          → kind: "button-like"
        - selector contains "a." or "link" or "nav" or only changes color/text-deco
          → kind: "link-like"
        - selector contains "card" or pattern matches repeating-item css
          → kind: "card-like"
        - otherwise → kind: "generic"
      The coordinator uses these tags to prioritize which components to apply
      to first when multiple components match the selector.

STEP 3 — NORMALIZE FOCUS DIFFS

  Same as STEP 2 but for focus state. Most focus diffs land on form inputs;
  tag with kind: "focus-input" or kind: "focus-button" based on selector.

STEP 4 — TRANSLATE CLICK-TO-OPEN ENTRIES

  These are different — they don't become `interactiveStyles`, they become
  notes for the coordinator to consider as separate components.

  For each clickToOpen entry:
    4a. Note the trigger selector + the revealed selector. These together
        suggest a stateful pattern (dropdown, modal, mobile menu).
    4b. Emit a "stateful-widget-hint" entry in the patch plan. The
        coordinator may decide to factor this into its own component
        (e.g. MobileMenu, NavDropdown) or skip it for now.
    4c. Do NOT include the revealed HTML in your patch plan — it can be
        huge. Just the selectors + a short trigger-text excerpt.

STEP 5 — WRITE patch-plan.json

  Output path: rendered-websites/<host>/pages/<pageSlug>/patch-plan.json

  Schema:
  {
    "version": 1,
    "interactions": [
      {
        "selector": ".cta-button.primary",
        "state": "hover",
        "kind": "button-like",
        "styles": {
          "color": ["#4F46E5", "#4338CA"],
          "background-color": ["#FFFFFF", "#F3F4F6"]
        }
      },
      {
        "selector": "input.email",
        "state": "focus",
        "kind": "focus-input",
        "styles": {
          "border-color": ["#D1D5DB", "#4F46E5"]
        }
      },
      ...
    ],
    "statefulWidgetHints": [
      {
        "triggerSelector": "button.menu-toggle",
        "triggerText": "Menu",
        "revealedSelector": ".menu-panel",
        "domDelta": 2048,
        "hint": "Looks like a mobile menu / nav drawer. Coordinator may factor as MobileMenu component."
      },
      ...
    ]
  }

STEP 6 — REPORT
  Print one-line summary:
    ✅ Patch plan: H hover + F focus + W stateful widget hints
```

## How the coordinator joins your output

(Informational — you don't do the join; you just produce the plan in the right shape.)

After the coordinator finishes componentization (STEP 2f-iv + 2f-v), it:

1. Reads `patch-plan.json` (your output).
2. For each `interactions[]` entry, finds the component whose carved tree contains a node matching the selector. The match is best-effort — selectors like `.cta-button` might match a node inside `HomeHero`, `Header`, or `HomePricing`. The `kind` tag helps prioritize.
3. Walks the component's structure to find the specific node matching the selector. Adds `interactiveStyles: { <state>: { ...styles map... } }` to that node.
4. For `statefulWidgetHints[]`, decides whether to factor (writes a new component) or skip (queues a follow-up).
5. Batches all changes into one `/api/save-components` call.

If a selector matches no component (e.g., the element was inside a section the coordinator skipped), the entry is logged as `unmatched` in the checkpoint and ignored — no error.

## Hard rules

- **Never write components.** Your output is one file: `patch-plan.json`. The coordinator is the only STEP 2 component writer.
- **Don't include large HTML in the patch plan.** `clickToOpen.revealedHtml` from the probe can be tens of KB — drop it from your output. The coordinator can re-read it from `interactions.json` if it needs the full DOM.
- **Normalize colors to hex.** Saves the coordinator a step at join time and matches what the extractor's `colorToHex()` emits inline.
- **Idempotent.** Re-running you with the same input produces identical output (sort entries deterministically — by selector, alphabetically).
- **Empty plan is valid.** If `interactions.json` is missing or has no diffs, write `{"version": 1, "interactions": [], "statefulWidgetHints": []}` and exit cleanly.

## Failure recovery

| Symptom | Action |
|---|---|
| `interactions.json` missing | Write empty patch plan; exit cleanly. The coordinator may have skipped probe for this page (e.g. low-affordance pages in STEP 4 batch). |
| Malformed `interactions.json` JSON | Halt — refuse to write a patch plan from corrupt input |
| Same selector appears twice in input | Merge entries (union of style properties) before emitting |

## When done

Print the one-line report. Return — the coordinator picks up your patch plan during its join phase.
