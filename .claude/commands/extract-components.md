# /extract-components $ARGUMENTS

Factor repeating UI patterns from a page's sections into globally-named, reusable components.

> **Non-interactive contract.** Never ask the user questions during this skill — see `.claude/docs/meno/studio-port.md`. Validation halts with a one-line error; uncertainty becomes a line in the final report.

## What to do

1. **Parse `$ARGUMENTS`.** First token is the page slug; optional `--port=N` overrides Studio port detection.
   - Halt with one-line error if the slug is empty, contains a slash, or ends in `.astro`.
   - If `--port` is present and not an integer in 1024–65535, drop it (don't halt).

2. **Validate the page exists.** Confirm `GET http://localhost:<STUDIO_PORT>/api/pages/<slug>` returns `200` (the format-transparent page model `{ meta, root }`). If missing, halt with a one-line error.

3. **Delegate to the `component-extractor` subagent** via the Task tool. The agent resolves the Studio port per `.claude/docs/meno/studio-port.md` and uses it for all API calls.

```
Task({
  description: "Extract components from <slug>",
  subagent_type: "component-extractor",
  prompt: "Analyze the page <slug> transitively (GET /api/pages/<slug> for the node tree). Studio port hint: <port-or-auto>. Detect repeating UI primitives + block components across all referenced sections, build them as globally-named components, rewrite the sections to reference them, and save everything via batched API calls. Follow .claude/agents/component-extractor.md exactly. Resolve the Studio port per .claude/docs/meno/studio-port.md. Report when done."
})
```

   Pass `auto` when the user didn't supply `--port`; otherwise pass the explicit number.

4. **When the subagent returns**, print its final report verbatim and stop. Do not summarize, kick off follow-up work, or ask the user what to do next.

## Notes

- **Intended order**: `/split-page <slug>` → `/extract-components <slug>` → `/add-interactivity <slug>`.
  - `/split-page` produces zero-prop section components with inline node trees.
  - `/extract-components` (this skill) factors repeating subtrees from those sections into reusable components and patches the sections to reference them.
  - `/add-interactivity` then walks the multi-level component tree and adds JS at the smallest meaningful scope (Button's `<script>` for hover, FAQItem's `<script>` for row toggle — not HomeFAQ).
- **This skill only touches structure.** It does NOT write JS. If a section already has interactivity JS (e.g. you ran `/add-interactivity` first), this skill leaves it alone — the user should re-run `/add-interactivity` after extraction to move JS to the right level.
- **Globally-named** (FAQItem, not HomeFAQItem). Numeric suffix on collision (FAQItem, FAQItem2).
- **Closed UI primitive catalog**: Button, Badge, Input, Checkbox, Tag, IconButton. Block components are open-ended with semantic naming.
- The Studio **editor** server must be running on some port between 3000–3009 (NOT the SSR preview, which uses 8080–8089). The agent detects which.
